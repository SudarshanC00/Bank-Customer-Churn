# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in a bank using a machine learning model. Customer churn prediction helps identify clients likely to close their accounts, enabling banks to take proactive measures to retain customers. The project uses a Jupyter Notebook that preprocesses data, trains a model, and evaluates its accuracy.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loads the dataset, handles missing values, and performs feature engineering.
- **Model Training**: Trains a machine learning model to predict customer churn.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance and displays accuracy and other metrics.

## File Structure
- **Bank_Customer_Churn.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SudarshanC00/Bank-Customer-Churn.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Bank_Customer_Churn.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Train the machine learning model.
   - Evaluate the model's performance with accuracy and other metrics.

## Model Details
- **Dataset**: Contains various features about bank customers to predict churn likelihood.
- **Target Variable**: Churn (binary classification: churned or not churned).
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess model performance.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and model building.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive environment for coding and visualizing results.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library for model building and evaluation.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Visualization libraries for plotting data insights and model performance.
